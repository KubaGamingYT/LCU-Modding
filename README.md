How do i mod LEGO City Undercover? That's probably the question you asked yourself while clicking on this document. This document will help you out.

# EXTRACTING FILES
First start off by going to your steamapps folder and then find LEGO City Undercover.

If you did that then the extraction is easy, just follow my tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYOdEW9B5hg&t. If you didn't understand something, please dm me on discord: kubagaming_.

# ADDING UNUSED CHARACTERS INTO THE GAME
Every character in the game has 2 files.

.CD file, which is an file that contains data like textures, hairs, faces etc.
and
.TXT file, which contains speed of an character etc.

# WARNING!
Remember that unused characters don't have .txt files.

Anyways adding them is easy.

First locate your character, then copy an close enough .txt file and rename it to match the character.

Now open the CHARS folder and locate the COLLECTION.TXT file, scroll down and write

Collect (your character name here so for example:) Cop_InternHoney cat 1

That's all!
